Did you know...

ARM means Asteroid Redirect Mission.

There's an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt. It is 950 km (590 miles) in diameter.

An asteroid the size of a house would cause some serious damage if it fell to earth. But it would destroyed the planet ;)

NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

NASA was established after the Soviets launched the first satellite, the Sputnik 1.

The rings of Saturn are made of some kind of white ice and satellites (like the moon).

A satellite is an object orbiting around another object in space, like the moon orbits around the earth.

Saturn has nearly 10 rings.

Research on asteroids help us humans understand more about the Universe and what is out there.
